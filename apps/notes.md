# MQTT Clients

## MQTT Real-World Candidates
The following candidates are MQTT applications extracted from the [awesome repo](https://github.com/MQTTCool/awesome-mqtt#smart-home-hardware-interfaces) or
[mqtt-smarthome list](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome/blob/master/Software.md).

 - [kodi2mqtt](https://github.com/owagner/kodi2mqtt) - MQTT addon for Kodi Mediacenter \\
 - [hue2mqtt](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/hue2mqtt.js) - Gateway between a Philips Hue bridge and MQTT \\
 - [ipcam2mqtt](https://github.com/svrooij/ipcam2mqtt) - IPCamera alarm to MQTT bridge \\
 - [chromoflex2mqtt](https://github.com/owagner/chromoflex2mqtt) - Control Chromoflex USP3 RGB LED modules via MQTT \\
 - [aqara-mqtt](https://github.com/monster1025/aqara-mqtt) - Aqara (Xiaomi) Gateway to MQTT bridge \\

## Interesting stuff to look into
 - [Async API](https://www.asyncapi.com/) -  tools to easily build and maintain event-driven architectures.
 - [HIVE MQ](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/real-world-examples-of-hivemq-and-mqtt/) - real world examples of hivemq and mqtt.

## TODO
 - [deployment] Test each app on Raspberry Pi. 
 - [deployment] Test Raspberry Pi Swarm [link](https://howchoo.com/g/njy4zdm3mwy/how-to-run-a-raspberry-pi-cluster-with-docker-swarm#create-the-swarm).
